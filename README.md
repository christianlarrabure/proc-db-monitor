This utility will print you the amount of RAM being used in your system in total and also connects to a database of your choosing and tells you the amount of connected threadas.

Check .env.example for information on how to set it up.

This tool is useful for cheap, quick diagnostics (i.e. when doing a migration and need to quickly gauge usage in systems that do not have monitoring tools).
